A user-friendly design is crucial because it determines how effectively and efficiently users can interact with a product or service. It is important because:

1. *Improves User Satisfaction*: A clean, intuitive design helps users accomplish tasks easily, leading to a more positive experience.

2. *Increases Engagement and Retention*: Users are more likely to return to and engage with a platform that feels comfortable and straightforward to use.

3. *Reduces Frustration and Errors*: Well-designed interfaces minimize confusion and the chance of making mistakes.

### Typograpy
- Primary Font: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
- Headings: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px

Identifying design properties of a mock up design is important to:
1. *Facilitates Development*: Developers can reference exact values (e.g., padding, font size, colors) from the mockup, speeding up front-end implementation and reducing guesswork.

2. *Ensures Consistency*: Recognizing elements like button styles, input fields, and component dimensions ensures a cohesive look and feel across the entire interface.

3. *Supports Responsiveness*: Knowing how design properties behave across different screen sizes helps create interfaces that adapt well to mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
